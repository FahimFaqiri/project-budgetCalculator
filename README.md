# project-budgetCalculator

* In this project i created a budget calculator, that will manipulate the user input to show the expenses and incomes. Together with that there's also the percentage spended from  the total income. This project is focused mainly on the javascript mastery and less on the HTML, CSS and so this is not a responsive design.

* This code will produce both the incomes and the expenses whilst also retracting and adding both values, both values stored inside objects in the project and will be shown to the user interface with some integrated HTML. 

* There are no fameworks used for this project, just some plain old vanilla Javascript.

* This project is deployed and i would love for people to see and use this project online, when they need to calculate some stuff.

* This project is completed!! check it out at ...
